Interesting. After I follow the scipy git directions I got
much less confused!

When I run the script and the data directory gets created, 
git doesn't seem to notice it. It doesn't show up in my 
status listing and when I do "git add data" nothing seems to
happen. I wonder if this is a config thing. Will try to figure it out.
