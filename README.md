Repository for the SWC homework in Nov. 2013


Possible ideas for the project, and just to fill out this file some...


- shell completion (zsh or bash)
- python
- matlab
- make



Pauline's ideas will go here, just as soon as I have some.
But now I can use this modified file to test out my git-fu.


DJ:  I didn't understand the directions fully for the homework.   I need
to read the correct part of the SWC repository for potential topics...
